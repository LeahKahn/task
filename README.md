# Scripting and automation task
Task to be judged:  scrape website data using scrapy<br>
Main Script under: task/ecommerce/ecommerce/spiders/parseWeb.py<br>
Run the script using scrapy shell and output json file using "scrapy crawl comm -o items.json"<br><br>
For BONUS TASK: The bypass.py file has been created although it runs in some cases and some not. The script requires use of chromedriver.exe and it is to be stored in the same folder as <i>bypass.py</i>. Also, the program makes the Chrome window minimize and maximize to fool to be a human touch but that makes it work in some cases and in some not.
